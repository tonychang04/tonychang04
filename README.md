### About
----------------------
Simply trying to help others around me. 

Others call me a software engineer, but I prefer calling myself an optimistic philosopher. 
My journey in software engineering has not just been about coding and technology; it's been a path of learning, self-discovery, and understanding how these skills can contribute to the greater good. Technology is a tool, but philosophy is the guide that shapes its use for positive impact. I believe in the power of positive thinking and continuous personal growth, seeking not just to develop software solutions, but to inspire those I encounter along my professional and personal journey.
